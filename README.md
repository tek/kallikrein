# Intro

**kallikrein** is a Scala testing framework for sbt focused on running [cats-effect] based programs.

If you're into matcher DSLs, check out [xpct], which is a framework-agnostic typed matcher lib with support for
**kallikrein**.

## module ids

```sbt
"io.tryp" %% "kallikrein-sbt" % "0.5.2"
"io.tryp" %% "kallikrein-http4s-sbt" % "0.5.2"
```

## sbt

To use the framework in a project, specify the setting:

```sbt
testFrameworks += new TestFramework("klk.KlkFramework")
```

# Basics

## Imperative DSL

```scala
class SomeTest
extends klk.IOTest
{
  test("description")(IO.pure(1 == 1))
}
```

Tests are added by calling the `test` function in a class inheriting `klk.SimpleTest[F]`, where `F[_]` is an effect that
implements `cats.effect.Sync`.
`klk.IOTest` is a convenience trait using `cats.effect.IO`.

Assertions are returned from the test thunk and can be anything, as long as there is an instance for `klk.TestResult`.
The internal type representing the result is `KlkResult`.

## Composable Tests

The above mentioned `test` builder can also be used in a pure context and has a nice arsenal of typeclass instances for
composition.

When tests are sequenced in a for comprehension, the semantic effect is that of conditional execution:
If one test fails, all following tests are skipped.

There is an instance of `SemigroupK` available, allowing you to use the `<+>` operator, resulting in the alternative, or
`unless`, semantics â€“ i.e. if and only if the first test fails, execute the second one and use its result.

For independent tests, there are two combinators: `sequential` and `parallel`.
They do what you would expect, similar to the imperative test building syntax.
The `parallel` variant requires an instances of `cats.Parallel` and will execute the tests with a `parTraverse`.

The following example will result in a successful end result:

```scala
class DepTest
extends ComposeTest[IO, SbtResources]
{
  def testSuccess: IO[Boolean] =
    IO.pure(true)

  def testFail: IO[Boolean] =
    IO.raiseError(new Exception("boom"))

  implicit def cs: ContextShift[IO] =
    IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)

  def tests: Suite[IO, Unit, Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- sharedResource(Resource.pure(5))(
        builder =>
          builder.test("five is 4")(five => IO.pure(five == 4)) <+>
          builder.test("five is 5")(five => IO.pure(five == 5))
      )
      _ <- test("test 1")(testSuccess)
      _ <- test("test 2")(testFail) <+> test("test 3")(testSuccess)
      _ <- Suite.parallel(test("test 4a")(testSuccess), test("test 4b")(testSuccess)) <+> test("test 5")(testFail)
      _ <- test("test 7")(testSuccess)
    } yield ()
}
```

# Results and Effects

The effect type of an individual test can be different from the main effect if there is an instance of `klk.Compile[F,
G]`.
For example, `EitherT` is supported out of the box:

```scala
test("EitherT")(EitherT.right[Unit](IO.pure(1 == 1)))
```

A `Left` value will be converted into a failure by the typeclass `TestResult[A]`, meaning that this works just as well with
`IO[Either[A, B]]`.

## fs2

A `Stream[F, A]` will automatically be compiled to `F`, with the inner value being handled by a dependent typeclass
instance.

## http4s

The `kallikrein-http4s-sbt` module provides a [shared resource](#resources) that runs an [http4s] server on a random
port and supplies tests with a client and the `Uri` of the server wrapped in a test client interface:

```scala
class SomeTest
extends klk.Http4sTest[IO]
{
  def tests: Suite[IO, Unit, Unit] =
    server
      .app(HttpApp.liftF(IO.pure(Response[IO]())))
      .test { builder =>
      builder.test("http4s") { client =>
        client.fetch(Request[IO]())(_ => IO.pure(true))
      }
    }
}
```

The `TestClient` class provides a `fetch` method that injects the uri into the request with its
`withUri(request: Request[F])` method, as well as a `success` method, which produces a failed `KlkResult` if the
response status is other than `2xx`.

# Resources

Tests can depend on shared and individual resources that will be supplied by the framework when running:

```scala
class SomeTest
extends klk.IOTest
{
  val res1: Resource[IO, Int] = Resource.pure(1)

  val res2: Resource[IO, Int] = Resource.pure(1)

  test("resource").resource(res1).resource(res2)((i: Int) => (j: Int) => IO.pure(i == j))

  def eightySix: SharedResource[IO, Int] =
    sharedResource(Resource.pure(86))

  eightySix.test("shared resource 1")(i => IO.pure(i == 86))

  eightySix.test("shared resource 2")(i => IO.pure(i == 68))
}
```

The shared resource will be acquired only once and supplied to all tests that use it.

# Property Testing

[Scalacheck] can be used in a test by calling the `forall` method on a test builder:

```scala
class SomeTest
extends klk.IOTest
{
  test("are all lists of integers shorter than 5 elements?").forall((l1: List[Int]) => IO(l1.size < 5))
}
```

This features a custom runner for the properties built on fs2.

A second variant `forallNoShrink` does what it advertises.

# Law Checking

[cats-discipline] laws can be checked like this:

```scala
class SomeTest
extends klk.IOTest
{
  test("laws").laws(IO.pure(FunctorTests[List].functor[Int, Int, Int]))
}
```
